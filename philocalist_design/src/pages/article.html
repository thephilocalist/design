            Crouching next to the distinct piles of grass, metal bucket at his feet, the patawala takes handfuls of long grass, folds them in half, snaps each over the bucket edge, then pulls the conglomeration apart to make a rowboat-shaped container with long reeds trailing behind it.
            
            With his hands, the patawala scoops out a precise serving of rice mixture and wraps the remaining grass to create a lid. To secure the bundle, two long strands are woven around the pod in an intricate tie that appears to have at least four variations. Faridul, Surya’s lead mahout, comes over to help.
            
                The deeply personal bond between each elephant and their mahout caretaker is the most critical aspect for all of their work together.
            
            If Faridul is only authoritative and the patawala the main source of all food, the delicate bond can become imbalanced. Besides, this tusker will consume about 20-30 pods twice a day. Just as soon as one is made, it is popped into the elephant’s mouth; eating the works of art as if they are handfuls of nuts.
            
            
            The river is far too treacherous for a human to attempt a swim. He is in luck, Suriya is approaching through the grasslands. The patawala and Surya help the farmer to climb on. At the deepest point, though the water covers the men’s feet, Surya moves with grace, agility, and strength. A strong wake of waves flanks his sides as he makes his way to shore.
